# Writing a utility function ----------------------------------------------

# P1: How did you extract the temperature and exposure from the hottest day?
# Copy-paste the code here.

# P2: Fill in the blanks below to write the Alaskan datetime utility function.
??? <- ???(???) {
  ???
  return(???)
}

# Extracting data ---------------------------------------------------------

# P3: Make a copy of your code from P1 and edit it to plot the temperature and
# exposure for "Aialik" on 2012-06-01

# P4: Make a copy of your code from P3 and edit it to plot the temperature and
# exposure for "Harris" on 2016-04-05.

# P5: Compare your solutions for P3 and P4 - what variables changed?

# P6: What you would pick for the temperature extraction function and
# parameters' names?

# Writing extraction functions --------------------------------------------

# P7: Fill in the blanks in the code below to write your temperature extraction
# function.

??? <- ???(???, ???, ???) {
  ??? <- your_utility_function_name_here(???)
  ??? <- your_utility_function_name_here(???)
  ???
  return(???)
}

# P8: Make a copy of your solution to P7, and edit it to create exposure and
# datetime extraction functions.

# P9: Export your annotated screenshot as a JPEG called "annotated_function.jpg"
# and add it to your copy of the module repository. (It should be in the same
# folder as this file.)

# P10: Visualize Nuka Pass on July 1, 2018.

# P11: Save a copy of the Nuka Pass plot as "nuka_pass_2018-07-01.png" in this
# repo

# P12: Compare the code you wrote to create the plot in this module to the code
# you wrote in PROG101. Qualitatively, how do they compare? Which one is easier
# to read and why?
